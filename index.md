# Welcome to My GitHub Pages

My name is Zhongbin Huang. I am currently a data scientist consultant working at a part-time basis.
I recently graduated from the University of Toronto. I have a master and bachelor degree both in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering. On my spare time, I like playing computer games, cooking and reading
books. My favorite quote is "苟利国家生死以，岂因祸福避趋之".
