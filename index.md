# About Me

My name is Zhongbin Huang. I am currently a data scientist consultant working at a part-time basis.
I recently graduated from the University of Toronto. I have a master and bachelor degree both in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering. On my spare time, I like playing computer games, cooking and reading
books. My favorite quote is ["苟利国家生死以，岂因祸福避趋之"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZxltK2K_h4).

##### [Accounting AI Startup Project](https://bobohope.github.io/assets/documents/Receipt_Project_presentation_2.pdf)

- Worked in an agile data science team to help the client improve its machine learning 
model process. My responsibility in this project was to leverage Machine Learning to help 
achieve 85% recall on OCR results in one of the key feature category of the app 
- Parsed millions of Google scanning OCR output using Python in an AWS cloud 
environment 
- Cleaned raw data extracted from a Postgre database
- Developed machine learning models to predict merchant name, spent amount, address in 
receipts and achieved more than 50% improvement on model accuracy over client’s 
benchmark model
- Built a python Flask-based prediction API for testing and evaluation

##### [Education Institute Marketing Campaign Project](https://bobohope.github.io/assets/documents/Digital_Marketing.pdf)
- Built marketing data collection pipeline and visualization tools to help client target new 
customer and students. My responsibility in this project was to use various big data tools 
to build the data lake architecture and automate processes. 
- Use various APIs such as google analytics API and Gmail API to collect information from 
different data sources and automate all the processes using Apache Airflow. 
- Built Apache Superset dashboard to visualize data that stored in BigQuery cloud 
database 
- Put applications into Docker image and used a Google Cloud Kubernetes cluster to 
integrate and host all the apps to enable auto-scaling and load-balancing

### [Weyerhaeuser](https://www.weyerhaeuser.com), Alberta​ - IT Support and App Development (Co-op) 
_MAY 2015 - DEC 2015_

- Designed and developed a live KPI dashboard using VB.net and SQL to help the 
company increase the awareness of key performance metrics to its hundreds of 
employees 
- Scheduled daily automated emails to send reports to upper management teams
- Integrated the application to existing process control HMI in operating rooms and 
business computers in the office 
- Built ad-hoc reports and provided recommendations to operation and maintenance teams

### [Suncor Energy](https://www.suncor.com), Alberta - Electrical, Instrumentation and Control Engineer (Co-op)
